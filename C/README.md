# Reading CSV files with Eigen and Boost  

If using a CSV file different than **winedata** or **i (insurance)**, just add the CSV file to the same directory and change the name in the `Makefile`.  

The `Makefile` is using the `clang++` compiler. If you are using the `g++` compiler, make sure to change the `CXX` variable.    

### Compile using **Make**  

```
make
```  

### Run with **Make**  

```
make run
```  

### Delete the `main` executable  

```
make clean
```
