### How to run files?  

For all examples I used a `Makefile` that compiles and runs the file.  

Change the `*.cpp` to the file name that you want to run.  

Go to a terminal and type: 

```
make 
#to remove the executable file
make clean
```  

Compiler used: `clang++`   
Flags used: `-Wall` `-O2` `-std=c++11`
